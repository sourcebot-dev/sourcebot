All core Sourcebot features are available in Sourcebot OSS (MIT Licensed). Some additional features require a license key. See the [pricing page](https://www.sourcebot.dev/pricing) for more details.


## Activating a license key

After purchasing a license key, you can activate it by setting the `SOURCEBOT_EE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
docker run \
    -e SOURCEBOT_EE_LICENSE_KEY=<your-license-key> \
    /* additional args */ \
    ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```
