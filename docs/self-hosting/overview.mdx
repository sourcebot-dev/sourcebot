<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a config">
        By default, Sourcebot requires a configuration file with a list of [code host connections](/docs/connections/overview) that specify what repositories should be **synced** (cloned and indexed). To get started, run the following command to create a starter `config.json`:

        ```bash
        touch config.json
        echo '{
            "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/schemas/v3/index.json",
            "connections": {
                // Comments are supported
                "starter-connection": {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }' > config.json
        ```

        This config creates a single GitHub connection named `starter-connection` that specifies [Sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot) as a repo to sync.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Launch your instance">
        <Note>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/self-hosting/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable</Note>
        Sourcebot is packaged as a [single Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot). In the same directory as `config.json`, run the following command to start your instance:

        ``` bash
        docker run \
            -p 3000:3000 \
            --pull=always \
            --rm \
            -v $(pwd):/data \
            -e CONFIG_PATH=/data/config.json \
            --name sourcebot \
            ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
        ```

        Navigate to `localhost:3000` to start searching the Sourcebot repo.
    
        <Accordion title="Details">
            **This command**:
                - pulls the latest version of the `sourcebot` docker image.
                - mounts the working directory to `/data` in the container to allow Sourcebot to persist data across restarts, and to access the `config.json`. In your local directory, you should see a `.sourcebot` folder created that contains all persistent data.
                - runs any pending database migrations.
                - starts up all services, including the webserver exposed on port 3000.
                - reads `config.json` and starts syncing.
        </Accordion>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the owner account">
        Sourcebot has built-in authentication which gates your instance. The first account which is registered on a fresh Sourcebot deployment is made owner.
        
        Registration is performed using basic credentials which are stored encrypted within your deployment. To setup more authentication providers
        check out the [auth docs](/self-hosting/configuration/authentication)

    <Step title="Link your code">
        Sourcebot supports indexing public & private code on the following code hosts:

## Architecture

Sourcebot is shipped as a single docker container that runs a collection of services using [supervisord](https://supervisord.org/):

![architecture diagram](/images/architecture_diagram.png)

{/*TODO: outline the different services, how Sourcebot communicates with code hosts, and the different*/}

Sourcebot consists of the following components:
- **Web Server** : main Next.js web application serving the Sourcebot UI.
- **Backend Worker** : Node.js process that incrementally syncs with code hosts (e.g., GitHub, GitLab etc.) and asynchronously indexes configured repositories.
- **Zoekt** : the [open-source](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt), trigram indexing code search engine that powers Sourcebot under the hood.
- **Postgres** : transactional database for storing business-logic data.
- **Redis Job Queue** : fast in-memory store. Used with [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) for queuing asynchronous work.
- **`.sourcebot/` cache** : file-system cache where persistent data is written.

You can use managed Redis / Postgres services that run outside of the Sourcebot container by providing the `REDIS_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables, respectively. See the [configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) for more configuration options.

## Scalability

One of our design philosophies for Sourcebot is to keep our infrastructure [radically simple](https://www.radicalsimpli.city/) while balancing scalability concerns. Depending on the number of repositories you have indexed and the instance you are running Sourcebot on, you may experience slow search times or other performance degradations. Our recommendation is to vertically scale your instance by increasing the number of CPU cores and memory.

Sourcebot does not support horizontal scaling at this time, but it is on our roadmap. If this is something your team would be interested in, please contact us at [team@sourcebot.dev](mailto:team@sourcebot.dev).


## Telemetry
By default, Sourcebot collects anonymized usage data through [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to help us improve the performance and reliability of our tool. We don't collect or transmit <a href="https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~/search?query=captureEvent%5C(%20repo%3Asourcebot">any information related to your codebase</a>. In addition, all events are [sanitized](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/blob/HEAD/packages/web/src/app/posthogProvider.tsx) to ensure that no sensitive details (ex. ip address, query info) leave your machine. 

The data we collect includes general usage statistics and metadata such as query performance (e.g., search duration, error rates) to monitor the application's health and functionality. This information helps us better understand how Sourcebot is used and where improvements can be made.

If you'd like to disable all telemetry, you can do so by setting the environment variable `SOURCEBOT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `true`:

```bash
docker run \
  -e SOURCEBOT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true \
  /* additional args */ \
  ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```

If you disabled telemetry correctly, you'll see the following log when starting Sourcebot:

```sh
Disabling telemetry since SOURCEBOT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED was set.
