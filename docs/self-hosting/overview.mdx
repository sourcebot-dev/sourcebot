Sourcebot is open source and can be self-hosted using our official Docker images. To get started, run the following command:

``` bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --name sourcebot ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:staging
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see your Sourcebot deployment in action. Check out the [README](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/tree/main) to learn how to configure Sourcebot to index your repos.

### Telemetry

By default, Sourcebot collects anonymized usage data through [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to help us improve the performance and reliability of our tool. We don't collect or transmit [any information related to your codebase](https://sourcebot.dev/search/search?query=captureEvent%20repo%3Asourcebot%20case%3Ano). In addition, all events are [sanitized](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/blob/HEAD/packages/web/src/app/posthogProvider.tsx) to ensure that no sensitive details (ex. ip address, query info) leave your machine. 

The data we collect includes general usage statistics and metadata such as query performance (e.g., search duration, error rates) to monitor the application's health and functionality. This information helps us better understand how Sourcebot is used and where improvements can be made :)

If you'd like to disable all telemetry, you can do so by setting the environment variable `SOURCEBOT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1` in the docker run command:

```bash
docker run -e SOURCEBOT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 /* additional args */ ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```
