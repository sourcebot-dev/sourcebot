Sourcebot has built-in authentication that gates access to your organization. OAuth, email codes, and email / password are supported.

# Authentication Providers

To enable an authentication provider in Sourcebot, configure the required environment variables for the provider. Under the hood, Sourcebot uses Auth.js which supports [many providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth). Submit a [feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/discussions/categories/ideas) if you want us to add support for a specific provider.


## Email / Password
---
Email / password authentication is enabled by default. It can be **disabled** by setting `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_LOGIN_ENABLED` to `false`.

## Email codes
---
Email codes are 6 digit codes sent to a provided email. Email codes are enabled when transactional emails are configured using the following environment variables:

- `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL`
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`


See [transactional emails](/self-hosting/features/transactional-emails) for more details.

## GitHub

- `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Google

# Disable Authentication

Authentication can be disabled by setting the `SOURCEBOT_AUTH_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`. When authentication is disabled:

- Your Sourcebot instance can be accessed without signing in.
- All organization & team-management features are disabled. (e.g., invites, organization settings, etc.)
- Connections management via the UI is disabled, and can only be [configured declaratively](/self-hosting/features/declarative-config).


Note that this feature is **only** available when `SOURCEBOT_TENANCY_MODE` is set to `single`.


# Troubleshooting

- If you experience issues logging in, logging out, or accessing an organization you should have access to, try clearing your cookies & performing a full page refresh (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R` on most browsers).
