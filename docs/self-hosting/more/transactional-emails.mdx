To enable transactional emails in your deployment, set the following environment variables. We recommend using [Resend](https://resend.com/), but you can use any provider. Setting this enables you to:

- Send emails when new members are invited
- Log into the Sourcebot deployment using [email codes](self-hosting/more/authentication#email-codes)

| Variable | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` | SMTP server connection. |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | The sender's email address |
