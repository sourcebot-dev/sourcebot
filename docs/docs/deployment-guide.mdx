The following guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Sourcebot on your own infrastructure. Sourcebot is distributed as a [single docker container](/docs/overview#architecture) that can be deployed to a k8s cluster, a VM, or any platform that supports docker.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Requirements">
        - Docker -> use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Mac or Windows.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a config.json">
        Create a `config.json` file that tells Sourcebot which repositories to sync and index:

        ```bash wrap icon="terminal" Create example config
        touch config.json
        echo '{
            "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/schemas/v3/index.json",
            "connections": {
                // comments are supported 
                "starter-connection": {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }' > config.json
        ```

        This config creates a single GitHub connection named `starter-connection` that specifies [Sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot) as a repo to sync. [Learn more about the config file](/docs/configuration/config-file).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Launch your instance">
        <Warning>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable.</Warning>


        In the same directory as `config.json`, run the following command to start your instance:

        ``` bash icon="terminal" Start the Sourcebot container
        docker run \
            -p 3000:3000 \
            --pull=always \
            --rm \
            -v $(pwd):/data \
            -e CONFIG_PATH=/data/config.json \
            --name sourcebot \
            ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
        ```

        <Accordion title="Details">
            **This command**:
                - pulls the latest version of the `sourcebot` docker image.
                - mounts the working directory to `/data` in the container to allow Sourcebot to persist data across restarts, and to access the `config.json`. In your local directory, you should see a `.sourcebot` folder created that contains all persistent data.
                - runs any pending database migrations.
                - starts up all services, including the webserver exposed on port 3000.
                - reads `config.json` and starts syncing.
        </Accordion>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and complete the onboarding flow.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Done">
        You're all set! If you'd like to setup [Ask Sourcebot](/docs/features/ask/overview), configure a language model [provider](/docs/configuration/language-model-providers).
    </Step>
