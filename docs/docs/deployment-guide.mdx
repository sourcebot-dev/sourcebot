Sourcebot is distributed as a [single docker container](/docs/overview#architecture) that can be deployed to a k8s cluster, a VM, or any platform that supports docker. The following guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Sourcebot locally using [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

## Walkthrough
---

<Steps>
    <Step title="Requirements">
        - docker & docker compose -> use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Mac or Windows.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Obtain the Docker Compose file">
        Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file from the Sourcebot repository.

        ```bash wrap icon="terminal"
        curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/docker-compose.yml
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a config.json">
        Create a `config.json` file that tells Sourcebot which repositories to sync and index:

        ```bash wrap icon="terminal" Create example config
        touch config.json
        echo '{
            "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/schemas/v3/index.json",
            "connections": {
                // comments are supported 
                "starter-connection": {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }' > config.json
        ```

        This config creates a single GitHub connection named `starter-connection` that specifies [Sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot) as a repo to sync. [Learn more about the config file](/docs/configuration/config-file).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Launch your instance">
        <Warning>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable.</Warning>

        Launch your Sourcebot instance:

        ```bash wrap icon="terminal"
        docker compose up -d
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and complete the onboarding flow.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Done">
        You're all set! If you'd like to setup [Ask Sourcebot](/docs/features/ask/overview), configure a language model [provider](/docs/configuration/language-model-providers).
    </Step>
</Steps>

Checkout the [configuration docs](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) to learn more about how to configure your deployment.
