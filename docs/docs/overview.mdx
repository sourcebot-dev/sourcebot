Sourcebot is an **[open-source](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot) code search tool** that is purpose built to search multi-million line codebases in seconds. It integrates with [GitHub](/docs/connections/github), [GitLab](/docs/connections/gitlab), and [other platforms](/docs/connections).
