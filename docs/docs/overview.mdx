Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool ([Github](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). It allows teams to index repositories across various different platforms, and provides a powerful interface to search across them.

We have a [public demo](https://sourcebot.dev/search) if you'd like to try Sourcebot out before registering.

There are two ways to get started using Sourcebot:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sourcebot Cloud">
  A fully managed version of Sourcebot that is hosted and maintained by the Sourcebot team: https://app.sourcebot.dev/
  
  Best for teams who:
    - Have large indexing requirements (500+ repos)
    - Don't want to deal with the headache of managing their own Sourcebot deployment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-host Sourcebot">
  Run Sourcebot within your own infrastructure. Check out our [self-hosting](/self-hosting/overview) guide to get started (it takes < 1 minute to spin up)

  Best for teams who:
    - Want to try out Sourcebot without going through security review (everything stays on your machine)
    - Want full control over their Sourcebot deployment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once you know which Sourcebot deployment you want to use, check out the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page
