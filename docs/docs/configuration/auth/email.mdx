Sourcebot supports two forms of email-based authentication: traditional email/password and passwordless email codes.

## Email / Password

Email and password authentication is **enabled by default**. Users can sign up with an email address and password.

To disable email/password authentication, set the following environment variable:

```bash
AUTH_CREDENTIALS_LOGIN_ENABLED=false
```

## Email Codes

Email codes provide passwordless authentication by sending a 6-digit code to the user's email address.

To enable email codes, you must configure [transactional emails](/docs/configuration/transactional-emails) with the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_EMAIL_CODE_LOGIN_ENABLED` | Set to `true` to enable email code login |
| `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` | Your SMTP server connection string |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | The "from" address for authentication emails |

See [transactional emails](/docs/configuration/transactional-emails) for detailed setup instructions.
