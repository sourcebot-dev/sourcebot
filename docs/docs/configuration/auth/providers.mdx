title: Providers
---

Sourcebot supports a wide range of different authentication providers through it's integration with [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/). This page
highlights how to configure the various supported providers.

If there's an authentication provider you'd like us to support, please [reach out](https://www.sourcebot.dev/contact).

# Core Authentication Providers

### Email / Password
---
Email / password authentication is enabled by default. It can be **disabled** by setting `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_LOGIN_ENABLED` to `false`.

### Email codes
---
Email codes are 6 digit codes sent to a provided email. Email codes are enabled when transactional emails are configured using the following environment variables:

- `AUTH_EMAIL_CODE_LOGIN_ENABLED`
- `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL`
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`


See [transactional emails](/docs/configuration/transactional-emails) for more details.

# Enterprise Authentication Providers

Sourcebot supports authentication using several different [external identity providers](/docs/configuration/idp) as well. These identity providers require an
[enterprise license](/docs/license-key)
