<Warning>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable.</Warning>

Sourcebot's authentication system controls how users sign in to your deployment.

## Choosing Your Authentication Method

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I want users to sign in with email/password">
Email and password authentication is enabled by default. You can also enable [email codes](/docs/configuration/auth/email#email-codes) for passwordless login.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want users to sign in with Google, Okta, or another SSO provider">
Configure an [SSO provider](/docs/configuration/auth/sso). Sourcebot supports Google, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Keycloak, Authentik, and more.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want users to sign in with GitHub or GitLab">
Configure GitHub or GitLab as an [SSO provider](/docs/configuration/auth/sso). If you also want [permission syncing](/docs/features/permission-syncing), it will work automatically since users are already authenticated with that provider.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I use Okta/Google for SSO, but need GitHub/GitLab permission syncing">
Configure your primary SSO provider for login, then set up GitHub/GitLab as a [connected account](/docs/configuration/auth/connected-accounts). Users will sign in with your SSO provider, then separately link their GitHub/GitLab account.
</Accordion>
