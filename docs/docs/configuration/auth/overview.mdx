title: Overview
---

Sourcebot has built-in authentication that gates access to your organization. OAuth, email codes, and email / password are supported. 

The first account that's registered on a Sourcebot deployment is made the owner. All other users who register must be [approved](/docs/configuration/auth/overview#approving-new-members) by the owner.

# Approving New Members

All account registrations after the first account must be approved by the owner. The owner can see all join requests by going into **Settings -> Members**.

If you have an [enterprise license](/docs/license-key), you can enable [AUTH_EE_ENABLE_JIT_PROVISIONING](/docs/configuration/auth/overview#enterprise-authentication-providers) to 
have Sourcebot accounts automatically created and approved on registration.

You can setup emails to be sent when new join requests are created/approved by configurating [transactional emails](/docs/configuration/transactional-emails)
# Authentication Providers

To enable an authentication provider in Sourcebot, configure the required environment variables for the provider. Under the hood, Sourcebot uses Auth.js which supports [many providers](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth). Submit a [feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/discussions/categories/ideas) if you want us to add support for a specific provider.

## Core Authentication Providers

### Email / Password
---
Email / password authentication is enabled by default. It can be **disabled** by setting `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_LOGIN_ENABLED` to `false`.

### Email codes
---
Email codes are 6 digit codes sent to a provided email. Email codes are enabled when transactional emails are configured using the following environment variables:

- `AUTH_EMAIL_CODE_LOGIN_ENABLED`
- `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL`
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`


See [transactional emails](/docs/configuration/transactional-emails) for more details.

## Enterprise Authentication Providers

<Warning>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable to use these providers.</Warning>

The following authentication providers require an [enterprise license](/docs/license-key) to be enabled.

By default, a new user registering using these providers must have their join request accepted by the owner of the organization to join. To allow a user to join automatically when
they register for the first time, set the `AUTH_EE_ENABLE_JIT_PROVISIONING` environment variable to `true`.
