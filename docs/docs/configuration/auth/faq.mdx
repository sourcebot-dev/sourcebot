This page covers a range of frequently asked questions about Sourcebot's built-in authentication system.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I disable the authentication system?">
    No, at this time it's not possible to disable the authentication system. If this is preventing you from deploying Sourcebot
    within your organization please [reach out](https://www.sourcebot.dev/contact)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't want to restrict access to my Sourcebot deployment, what should I do?">
    Every user must register an account within your Sourcebot deployment. However, this dosn't mean their access
    is restricted.

    Unless member approval is required, anyone can sign up for an account on your deployment and immediately be granted access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does any data related to authentication (emails, passwords, etc) leave my deployment?">
    **No data related to authentication (or your code) leaves your deployment**. Authentication is handled
    purely by your deployment and the authentication providers you configure. 

    This data does not leave your device and is stored within in the database managed by your deployment. If you're
    using credential login, passwords are encrypted at rest and in transit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm deploying Sourcebot behind an identity proxy, do I still need to create an account in Sourcebot?">
    <Note>Please note that IAP bridges are an enterprise feature</Note>
    Sourcebot supports connecting your identity proxy directly into the built-in auth system using an IAP bridge. This allows Sourcebot to
    register and authenticate automatically on a successful identity proxy log in.

    Sourcebot currently supports [GCP IAP](/docs/configuration/auth/providers#gcp-iap). If you're using a different IAP
    and require support, please [reach out](https://www.sourcebot.dev/contact)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Sourcebot implement authentication?">
    Sourcebot uses [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) as its underlying authentication framework. Auth.js provides authentication providers
    (credientials, Google, GitHub, etc) and an interface to enable user registration and log in. Internally, Auth.js uses JWT to provide
    Sourcebot secure and reliable information about user authentication.
