There are various ways to configure how members can join a Sourcebot deployment. 

## Member Approval 

**By default, Sourcebot requires new members to be approved by the owner of the deploymen**. This section explains how approvals work and how
to configure this behavior.

### Configuration
Member approval can be configured by the owner of the deployment by navigating to **Settings -> Members**:

### Managing Requests

If member approval is enabled, new members will be asked to submit a join request after signing up. They will not have access to the Sourcebot deployment
until this request is approved by the owner.

The owner can see and manage all pending join requests by navigating to **Settings -> Members**.

## Invite link

If member approval is required, an owner of the deployment can enable an invite link. When enabled, users
can use this invite link to register and be automatically added to the organization without approval:
