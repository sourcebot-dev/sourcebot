There are various ways to configure how members can join a Sourcebot deployment. 

**By default, Sourcebot doesn't
require new members to be approved**. This means that new sign ups on your deployment are automatically added to 
the organization.

Member approval can be configured by an owner of the deployment by navigating to **Settings -> Members**:

## Invite link

If member approval is required, an owner of the deployment can enable an invite link. When enabled, users
can use this invite link to register and be automatically added to the organization without approval:
