When self-hosting Sourcebot, you **must** provide it a config file. This is done by defining a config file in a volume that's mounted to Sourcebot, and providing the path to this
file in the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. For example:

```bash icon="terminal" Passing in a CONFIG_PATH to Sourcebot
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/config.json:/data/config.json \
    -e CONFIG_PATH=/data/config.json \
    ... \ # other options
    ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```

The config file tells Sourcebot which repos to index, what language models to use, and various other settings as defined in the [schema](#config-file-schema).

# Config File Schema

The config file you provide Sourcebot must follow the [schema](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/blob/main/schemas/v3/index.json). This schema consists of the following properties:

- [Connections](/docs/connections/overview) (`connections`): Defines a set of connections that tell Sourcebot which repos to index and from where
- [Language Models](/docs/configuration/language-model-providers) (`models`): Defines a set of language model providers for use with [Ask Sourcebot](/docs/features/ask)
- [Settings](#settings) (`settings`): Additional settings to tweak your Sourcebot deployment
- [Search Contexts](/docs/features/search/search-contexts) (`contexts`): Groupings of repos that you can search against

# Config File Syncing

Sourcebot syncs the config file on startup, and automatically whenever a change is detected.

# Settings

The following are settings that can be provided in your config file to modify Sourcebot's behavior

| Setting                                   | Type    | Default    | Minimum | Description / Notes                                                                    |

| `resyncConnectionIntervalMs`              | number  | 24 hours   | 1       | Interval for checking connections that need re‑syncing.                                |
| `resyncConnectionPollingIntervalMs`       | number  | 1 second   | 1       | DB polling rate for connections that need re‑syncing.                                  |
| `reindexRepoPollingIntervalMs`            | number  | 1 second   | 1       | DB polling rate for repos that should be re‑indexed.                                   |
| `maxConnectionSyncJobConcurrency`         | number  | 8          | 1       | Concurrent connection‑sync jobs.                                                       |
