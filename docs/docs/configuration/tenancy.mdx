<Warning>If you're switching from single-tenant mode, delete the Sourcebot cache (the `.sourcebot` folder) before starting.</Warning>
<Warning>[Authentication](/docs/configuration/auth/overview) must be enabled to enable multi tenancy mode</Warning>
Multi tenancy allows your Sourcebot deployment to have **multiple organizations**, each with their own set of members and repos. To enable multi tenancy mode, define an environment variable
named `SOURCEBOT_TENANCY_MODE` and set its value to `multi`. When multi tenancy mode is enabled:

- Any members or repos that are configured in an organization are isolated to that organization
- Members must be invited to an organization to gain access 
- Members may be a part of multiple organizations and switch through them in the UI


### Organization creation form

When you sign in for the first time (assuming you didn't go through an invite), you'll be presented with the organization creation form. The member who creates
the organization will be the Owner.
