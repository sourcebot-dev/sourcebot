To enable transactional emails in your deployment, set the following environment variables. We recommend using [Resend](https://resend.com/), but you can use any provider. Setting this enables you to:

- Send emails when new members are invited
- Send emails when organization join requests are created/accepted
- Log into the Sourcebot deployment using [email codes](/docs/configuration/auth/overview#email-codes)

| Variable | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` | SMTP server connection (`smtp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]`)|
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | The sender's email address |
