# Overview

Permission syncing allows you to sync Access Permission Lists (ACLs) from a code host to Sourcebot. When configured, users signed into Sourcebot (via the code host's OAuth provider) will only be able to access repositories that they have access to on the code host. Practically, this means:

- Code Search results will only include repositories that the user has access to.
- Code navigation results will only include repositories that the user has access to.
- Ask Sourcebot (and the underlying LLM) will only have access to repositories that the user has access to.
- File browsing is scoped to the repositories that the user has access to.

Permission syncing can be enabled by setting the `EXPERIMENT_EE_PERMISSION_SYNC_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.

```bash
docker run \
    -e EXPERIMENT_EE_PERMISSION_SYNC_ENABLED=true \
    /* additional args */ \
    ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```

## Platform support

We are actively working on supporting more code hosts. If you'd like to see a specific code host supported, please [reach out](https://www.sourcebot.dev/contact).

# Getting started

## GitHub

Prerequisite: [Add GitHub as an OAuth provider](/docs/configuration/auth/providers#github).

Permission syncing works with **GitHub.com**, **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**, and **GitHub Enterprise Server**. For organization-owned repositories, users that have **read-only** access (or above) via the following methods will have their access synced to Sourcebot:
- Outside collaborators
- Organization members that are direct collaborators
- Organization members with access through team memberships
- Organization members with access through default organization permissions
- Organization owners.

**Notes:**
- A GitHub OAuth provider must be configured to (1) correlate a Sourcebot user with a GitHub user, and (2) to list repositories that the user has access to for [User driven syncing](/docs/features/permission-syncing#how-it-works).
- OAuth tokens must assume the `repo` scope in order to use the [List repositories for the authenticated user API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-repositories-for-the-authenticated-user) during [User driven syncing](/docs/features/permission-syncing#how-it-works). Sourcebot **will only** use this token for **reads**.

# How it works

Permission syncing works by periodically syncing ACLs from the code host(s) to Sourcebot to build an internal mapping between Users and Repositories. This mapping is hydrated in two directions:
- **User driven** : fetches the list of all repositories that a given user has access to.
- **Repo driven** : fetches the list of all users that have access to a given repository.

User driven and repo driven syncing occurs every 24 hours by default. These intervals can be configured using the following settings in the [config file](/docs/configuration/config-file):
| Setting                                         | Type    | Default    | Minimum |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|---------|
| `experiment_repoDrivenPermissionSyncIntervalMs` | number  | 24 hours   | 1       |
| `experiment_userDrivenPermissionSyncIntervalMs` | number  | 24 hours   | 1       |
