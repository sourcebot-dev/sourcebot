### Private (Default)
- Only the chat owner can view the conversation
- Other users cannot access the chat, even with the link
- You can explicitly invite specific org members to view the chat (requires [Enterprise license](/docs/license-key))

### Public
- Anyone with the link can view the conversation
- If [anonymous access](/docs/configuration/auth/access-settings) is enabled, no authentication is required to view
- Useful for sharing insights with your team or creating reference documentation
- Public chats can be duplicated by others
