Agents are currently a experimental feature. Have an idea for an agent that we haven't built? Submit a [feature request](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/discussions/categories/feature-requests) on our GitHub.

Agents are automations that leverage the code indexed on Sourcebot to perform a specific task. Once you've setup Sourcebot, check out the
