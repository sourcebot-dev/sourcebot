<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a config">
        By default, Sourcebot requires a configuration file with a list of [code host connections](/docs/connections/overview) that specify what repositories should be **synced** (cloned and indexed). To get started, run the following command to create a starter `config.json`:

        ```bash
        touch config.json
        echo '{
            "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/schemas/v3/index.json",
            "connections": {
                // Comments are supported
                "starter-connection": {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }' > config.json
        ```

        This config creates a single GitHub connection named `starter-connection` that specifies [Sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot) as a repo to sync.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Launch your instance">
        <Warning>If you're deploying Sourcebot behind a domain, you must set the [AUTH_URL](/docs/configuration/environment-variables) environment variable</Warning>
        Sourcebot is packaged as a [single Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot). In the same directory as `config.json`, run the following command to start your instance:

        ``` bash
        docker run \
            -p 3000:3000 \
            --pull=always \
            --rm \
            -v $(pwd):/data \
            -e CONFIG_PATH=/data/config.json \
            --name sourcebot \
            ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
        ```

        Navigate to `localhost:3000` to start searching the Sourcebot repo.
    
        <Accordion title="Details">
            **This command**:
                - pulls the latest version of the `sourcebot` docker image.
                - mounts the working directory to `/data` in the container to allow Sourcebot to persist data across restarts, and to access the `config.json`. In your local directory, you should see a `.sourcebot` folder created that contains all persistent data.
                - runs any pending database migrations.
                - starts up all services, including the webserver exposed on port 3000.
                - reads `config.json` and starts syncing.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the owner account">
        Sourcebot has built-in authentication which gates your instance. The first account which is registered on a fresh Sourcebot deployment is made owner.
        
        Registration is performed using basic credentials which are stored encrypted within your deployment. To setup more authentication providers
        check out the [auth docs](/docs/configuration/authentication)
