<Steps>
    <Step title="Register an account">
        Head over to [app.sourcebot.dev](https://app.sourcebot.dev) and create an account.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create an organization">
        After logging in, you'll be asked to create an organization. You'll invite your team members to this organization later so they can also use Sourcebot.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Link your code host">
        After selecting a code host you want to connect to, you'll be presented with the connection creation page. This page has the following three inputs:
        - Connection name (required): The name of the connection within Sourcebot
        - Secret (optional): An [access token](/access-tokens/overview) that is used to fetch private repos
        - Configuration: The JSON configuration schema that defines the repos/orgs to fetch. 

        For a more detailed explanation of connections, check out the [Connections](/docs/connections/overview) page.

        The example below shows a connection named `sourcebot-org` that fetches all of the repos for the `sourcebot-dev` GitHub organization, but excludes the `sourcebot-dev/zoekt` repo

        <Note>This page won't let you continue with an invalid connection schema. If you're hitting errors, make sure the input you're providing is a valid JSON</Note>

    </Step>
</Steps>

### Search

Once you create your organization's first connection successfully, you'll be redirected to your org's main search page. From here, you can use the search bar to search across all
of the repos you've indexed
