If you're using Sourcebot Cloud, or are self-hosting with [authentication](/self-hosting/more/authentication) enabled, you may have multiple members in your organization. Each
member has a role which defines their permissions:

| Role | Permission |
| :--- | :--------- |
| `Owner` | Each organization has a single `Owner`. This user has full access rights, including: connection management, organization management, and inviting new members. |
| `Member` | Read-only access to the organization. A `Member` can search across the repos indexed by an organization's connections, but may not manage the organization or its connections. |
