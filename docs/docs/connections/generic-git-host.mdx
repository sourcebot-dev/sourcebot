Sourcebot can sync code from any Git host (by clone url). This is helpful when you want to search code that not in a [supported code host](/docs/connections/overview#supported-code-hosts).

If you're not familiar with Sourcebot [connections](/docs/connections/overview), please read that overview first.

## Getting Started

To connect to a Git host, create a new [connection](/docs/connections/overview) with type `git` and specify the clone url in the `url` property. For example:

```json
{
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
}
```

Note that only `http` & `https` URLs are supported at this time.
