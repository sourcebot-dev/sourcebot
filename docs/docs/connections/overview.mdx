To index your code with Sourcebot, you must provide a configuration file. When running Sourcebot, this file must be mounted in a volume that is accessible to the container, with its
path specified in the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. For example:

```bash icon="terminal" Passing in a CONFIG_PATH to Sourcebot
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/config.json:/data/config.json \
    -e CONFIG_PATH=/data/config.json \
    ... \ # other config
    ghcr.io/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot:latest
```

## Config Schema

The configuration file defines a set of **connections**.  A connection in Sourcebot represents a link to a code host (such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). 

Each connection defines how Sourcebot should authenticate and interact with a particular host, and which repositories to sync and index from that host. Connections are uniquely identified by their name.

```json wrap icon="code" Example config with two connections
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/main/schemas/v3/index.json",
    "connections": {
        // 1. A connection to GitHub.com
        "github-connection": {
            "type": "github",
            "repos": [
                "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
            ],
            "token": {
                "env": "GITHUB_TOKEN"
            }
        },
        // 2. A self-hosted GitLab instance
        "gitlab-connection": {
            "type": "gitlab",
            "url": "https://gitlab.example.com",
            "groups": [
                "my-group",
                "my-other-group/sub-group"
            ],
            "token": {
                "env": "GITLAB_TOKEN"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Configuration files must conform to the [JSON schema](#schema-reference).

## Config Syncing
Sourcebot performs syncing in the background. Syncing consists of two steps:
1. Fetch the latest changes from `HEAD` (and any [additional branches](/docs/features/search/multi-branch-indexing)) from the code host.
2. Re-indexes the repository.

This is processed in a [job queue](/docs/overview#architecture), and is parallelized across multiple worker processes. Jobs will take longer to complete the first time a repository is synced, or when a diff is large.

On the home page, you can view the sync status of ongoing jobs:
