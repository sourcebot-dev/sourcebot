To connect your code to Sourcebot you create **connections**. A **connection** is a configuration object that describes how Sourcebot should fetch information from a supported code host.

There are two ways to define connections:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Declarative configuration file">
        This is only supported when self-hosting, and is the default mechanism to define connections. Connections are defined in a [JSON file](/self-hosting/configuration/declarative-config)
        and the path to the file is provided through the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="UI connection management">
        This is the only way to define connections when using Sourcebot Cloud, and can be configured when self-hosting by enabling [authentication](/self-hosting/configuration/authentications).

        In this method, connections are defined and managed within the webapp:

</AccordionGroup>
