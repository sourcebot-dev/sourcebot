This guide will walk you through upgrading your Sourcebot deployment from v2 to v3. 

<Warning>
Please note that the following features are no longer supported in v3:
- Local file indexing
- Raw remote `.git` repo indexing (i.e. not through a supported code host)

If your deployment is dependent on these features, please [reach out](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/discussions).
</Warning>

<Warning>This migration will require you to reindex all your repos</Warning>

    <Step title="Migrate your configuration file to the v3 schema">
        The main change between the v3 and v2 schemas is how the data is structured. In v2, you defined a `repos` array which contained unnamed config objects:

        ```json
        {
            "$schema": "./schemas/v2/index.json",
            "repos": [
                {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "gitlab":
                    "groups": [
                        "wireshark"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        In v3, you define a `connections` map which contains named `connection` objects:
        ```json
        {
            "$schema": "./schemas/v3/index.json",
            "connections": {
                "sourcebot-connection": {
                    "type": "github",
                    "repos": [
                        "sourcebot-dev/sourcebot"
                    ]
                },
                "wireshark-connection": {
                    "type": "gitlab":
                    "groups": [
                        "wireshark
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        The schema of the connections defined here is the same as the "repos" you defined in the v2 schema. Some helpful notes:
        
        - The name of the connection (`sourcebot-connection` and `wireshark-connection` above) is only used to identify the connection in Sourcebot. It can be any string that contains letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores
        - A connection is associated with one and only one code host platform, and this must be specified in the connections `type` field
        - Make sure you update the `$schema` field to point to the v3 schema
        - The `settings` object doesn't need to be changed. We've added new settings params (check out the v3 schema for more details)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your Sourcebot deployment">
        When you start up your Sourcebot deployment, it will create a fresh cache and begin indexing against your new v3 configuration file. 
        
        If there are issues with your configuration file it will provide an error in the console.
        After updating your configuration file, restart your Sourcebot deployment to pick up the new changes.
    </Step>
    <Step title="You're done!">
        Congrats, you've successfully migrated to v3! Please let us know what you think of the new features by reaching out on our [discord](https://discord.gg/HDScTs3ptP) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/issues/new/choose).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Some things to check:

- Make sure you update the `$schema` field in the configuration file to point to the v3 schema
- Make sure you have a name for each `connection`, and that the name only contains letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores
- Make sure each `connection` has a `type` field with a valid value (`gitlab`, `github`, `gitea`, `gerrit`)
